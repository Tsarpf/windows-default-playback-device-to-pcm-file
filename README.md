# Windows default playback device to pcm file
Writes any and all audio coming to the currently selected Windows default audio _playback_ device to a file in 16 bit 44.1khz stereo PCM


Can be used to record any audio that is currently playing.

- Only works on Windows (obviously)
- Only tested once on my computer.
- Made in C++ using WASAPI
- Mostly for my personal use in live audio visualization
